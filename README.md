# Canada Traffic Collisions Analysis
## Data Source: Canada's National Collision Database for the years 2018 and 2019.

This project aims to analyze and predict fatalities resulting from collisions on Canadian roads and identify causative factors through data analysis using Power BI.

Project Flow:

- Extracted around 215k records of road accidents from an S3 bucket, enhancing the data transformation process's efficiency.
- Developed a No-Code ETL pipeline using AWS Glue.
- Targeted data to AWS Athena.
- Streamlined integration with PowerBI, resulting in error-free data querying and modeling.
- Transformed datasets into actionable insights by developing interactive Power BI dashboards.

Note: Demonstration of AWS could not be possible due to restricted resources.
